## Projects
### Predicting Psychological Disorder in Parents of Children with Nephrotic Syndrome: A Comparative Study of Six (6) Machine Learning Classifiers
[Publication](https://www.ijres.org/v12-i10.html)

This research project aims to predict the likelihood of psychological disorders in parents of children with Nephrotic Syndrome using machine learning techniques. A comparative study of six classifiers is conducted on a dataset consisting of relevant features and psychological assessments.The findings have implications for early identification and targeted support, enhancing the well-being of parents and 
children affected by nephrotic syndrome.

### Importance of Community Screening in Prevention and Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and importance of community-based screening programs in the early detection of CKD and its risk factors. Specifically, it examines the prevalence of CKD and its risk factors within the Ikeja community

### Cassava Disease Classification
The project involved classifying pictures of cassava leaves into 1 of 4 disease categories (or healthy). The disease categories were: Cassava Mosaic Disease(CMD), Cassava Brown Streak Disease(CBSD), Cassava Bacterial Blight(CBB), and Cassava Green Mite(CGM).

### Object Tracker for Images and Videos
This project was about detection in time series data. The idea was to track objects in a video, by comparing the detected instances in two consecutive frames within a series of frames that make the video. My approach was to use color coding to track the number of detected objects.

### Ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms for Optimal Sensor Placement in a Controlled Environment using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
With the aim of combining these two algorithms to exact their predictive powers and reduce computational costs, this paper focuses on implementing the weighted average method and particle swarm optimization to ensemble these two models in order to predict the optimal sensors in a greenhouse.
