## Education							       		        		
- B.Tech., Computer Science | The Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria (_October 2018_)

## Work Experience
**Data Manager @ The Amplitude Study sponsored by Vertex Pharmaceuticals (_March 2024 - Present_)**
- Analyzed large-scale healthcare datasets to assess operational performance, including patient eligibility for clinical trials, clinician productivity, and resource allocation.
- Supported the team in extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data from general hospitals databases, laboratory databases and community outreaches programs to identify eligible participants for screening.
- Conducted data quality assurance (QA) on EDC data, identifying discrepancies, and implementing corrective actions to improve data integrity.

**Data Manager @ Human Heredity and Health in Africa (_June 2019 - Present_)**
- Managed and analyzed healthcare data to support clinical and operational decision-making, improving patient care outcomes by 55%.
- Utilized SQL, Excel, and Python to analyze patient data, identifying trends in clinical research recruitments, retention rates, treatment rates and follow-up rates.
- Provided data-driven recommendations to Consultants and Research Staffs for improving patient services, leading to a 35% reduction in loss to follow-up.

## Projects
### Predicting Psychological Disorder in Parents of Children with Nephrotic Syndrome: A Comparative Study of Six (6) Machine Learning Classifiers
[Publication](https://www.ijres.org/v12-i10.html)
This research project aims to predict the likelihood of psychological disorders in parents of children with Nephrotic Syndrome using machine learning techniques. A comparative study of six classifiers is conducted on a dataset consisting of relevant features and psychological assessments.The findings have implications for early identification and targeted support, enhancing the well-being of parents and 
children affected by nephrotic syndrome.

### Importance of Community Screening in Prevention and Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
[Research Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Tc89bbTudQJs7d3KKCi4B3wHNsBdCXA/view?usp=sharing)
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and importance of community-based screening programs in the early detection of CKD and its risk factors. Specifically, it examines the prevalence of CKD and its risk factors within the Ikeja community

### Cassava Disease Classification
The project involved classifying pictures of cassava leaves into 1 of 4 disease categories (or healthy). The disease categories were: Cassava Mosaic Disease(CMD), Cassava Brown Streak Disease(CBSD), Cassava Bacterial Blight(CBB), and Cassava Green Mite(CGM).

### Object Tracker for Images and Videos
This project was about detection in time series data. The idea was to track objects in a video, by comparing the detected instances in two consecutive frames within a series of frames that make the video. My approach was to use color coding to track the number of detected objects.

### Ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms for Optimal Sensor Placement in a Controlled Environment using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
[Link to Research Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O_CFMiJJ0iVNfJsNvda-n3Jt8FyCV-2C/view?usp=sharing)

With the aim of combining these two algorithms to exact their predictive powers and reduce computational costs, this paper focuses on implementing the weighted average method and particle swarm optimization to ensemble these two models in order to predict the optimal sensors in a greenhouse.
